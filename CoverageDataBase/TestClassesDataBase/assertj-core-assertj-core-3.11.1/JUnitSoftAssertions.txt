 * Same as  {@link SoftAssertions}, but with the following differences: <br> First, it's a junit rule, which can be used without having to call  {@link SoftAssertions#assertAll() assertAll()}, example: <pre><code class='java'> public class SoftlyTest { &#064;Rule public final JUnitSoftAssertions softly = new JUnitSoftAssertions(); &#064;Test public void testSoftly() throws Exception { softly.assertThat(1).isEqualTo(2); softly.assertThat(Lists.newArrayList(1, 2)).containsOnly(1, 2); } }</code></pre> Second, the failures are recognized by IDE's (like IntelliJ IDEA) which open a comparison window.
